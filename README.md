Number Guessing Game
This is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number between 1 and a specified maximum number.

Getting Started
To run the game, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can run the game by opening the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and navigating to the directory where the guessing_game.py file is located. Then, type the following command:

Copy code
python guessing_game.py
How to Play
When you start the game, you will be prompted to enter a number for the maximum range. Enter a positive integer and press Enter.

The program will generate a random number between 1 and the maximum range you specified.

You will have 5 guesses to try and guess the correct number. After each guess, the program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low, and how many guesses you have left.

If you guess the correct number within 5 guesses, you win! The program will tell you how many guesses it took you and your current score. You can then choose to play again or exit the game.

If you run out of guesses before guessing the correct number, you lose. The program will reveal the correct number and your current score. You can then choose to play again or exit the game.

Features
User-specified maximum range for the random number
Limited number of guesses (5)
Score system that rewards faster guesses
Play again option after each game
